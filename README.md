# RLCarExp
Reinforcement learning experiments with a simulated car.

## Details
This implements very simplistic q-learning (I think) and the car is simulated
either very simplistic with fixed speed or as a rigid body simulation with full
physics. There is some logging to HDF5 and learning going on. This is just an
experiments and very much in a state of constant flux.
